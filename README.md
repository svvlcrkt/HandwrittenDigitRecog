# *HandwrittenDigitRecog*

*The numbers you take a picture of with your computer camera (with the space key) are separated from each other by thresholding. Then, they are checked to fit the model trained with the MNIST dataset and operations such as thickening,adding the number by reducing it to the middle of the page and size reduction are applied. Then the numbers that fit into the dataset are predicted. And you can see the result of all of them step by step.*
